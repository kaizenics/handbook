                  Holy Cross of Davao College is a Catholic educational
                  institution nurtured by three religious institutions to answer
                  the needs of the community for quality education rooted in the
                  tradition of the Catholic faith. From 1951 -1956, the
                  Religious of the Virgin Mary Sisters (RVM) laid the foundation
                  upon which the school was founded. The Foreign Mission Society
                  of Quebec (PME Fathers) from 1957 â€“ 1976 strengthened and
                  improved these structures. And the Archdiocese of Davao from
                  1976 up to the present, building on the traditions of its
                  predecessors, expanded them to make the Holy Cross of Davao
                  College a prime college in the city of Davao, providing
                  affordable quality Catholic education not only to the people
                  of the city but also to the neighboring provinces.
